PETS is a model-based algorithm that consists of two main components: an ensemble of probabilistic models (each a feed-forward neural network), and a planner using the [Cross-Entropy Method](https://people.smp.uq.edu.au/DirkKroese/ps/aortut.pdf) (de Boer et al., 2004). \n",

We will also rely on several of the utilities available in the [mbrl.util](https://luisenp.github.io/mbrl-lib/util.html) module.

At every step in the loop, we execute an agent action in the environment and populate the replay buffer by calling ``util.step_env_and_add_to_buffer()``. Importantly, at the beginning of each episode we also call ``agent.reset()`` to clear any episode dependent cache; in the case of a ``TrajectoryOptimizerAgent``, this means clearing the previous action sequence found, which is shifted at every call to obtain an initial solution for the optimizer. \n",
